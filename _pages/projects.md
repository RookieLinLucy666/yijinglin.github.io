Here you can find an overview of my ongoing and completed research projects, including key highlights and objectives.
   
1. **Research on Blockchain-Network Integrated Unlearning Mechanisms for Data Element Circulation** 

   **面向数据要素流通的链网融合遗忘机制研究**  

   **Role:** PI, **Date:** 2024.09-2026.08, **Funding Agency:** Postdoctoral Innovative Talent Support Program

   This project aims to design efficient blockchain-based unlearning mechanisms to improve data privacy and sharing in decentralized systems. Key challenges include verifying data unlearning, scaling unlearning requests, and incentivizing participants. The project will focus on creating a blockchain-based framework for trusted federated unlearning and optimizing mechanisms for scalable and verifiable unlearning while maintaining model accuracy.

2. **Post-Hoc Fault-Tolerant Techniques for LLM-Generated Content Based on Unlearning**  

   **基于遗忘的大模型生成内容事后容错技术**
   
   **Role:** PI, **Date:** 2025.02-2026.01, **Funding Agency:** CCF-Huawei Populus Euphratica Innovation Research Project

   This project develops post-hoc fault-tolerant techniques for LLM-generated content by using unlearning methods to forget harmful or inaccurate data without retraining. It aims to enhance content generation by addressing challenges such as unlearning negative samples, coordinating unlearning across mixed models, and verifying unlearning in trusted models.
